											<h3>Erie Street Stylz Collective </h3>
											<p> As founder and former president of "Erie Street Stylz Collective"(street dance club) I pushed my self to make sure that our club grows while spreading the street dance culture by having events, workshops, public dance practices, etc. We received an Emerging club award from SGA President and Program Director for having the "most impact on campus in such a short time period for the 2018-2019 school year." </p>

											<h3>Organizing Events</h3>
											<p> One passion many may be unaware of is my love for throwing events. I love to see my ideas come to life. This event is known as "Battle for Erie". Dancers from all over the east coast came to compete in both the break-dancing and all styles bracket. In order to make sure this event was a success we had to write great proposals, market ourselves well, stay on top of deadlines, etc. You can say I was the project manager of the event. </p>

											<h3>Never miss a Conference</h3>
											<p>In my free time I love to take part in conferences. This is one of the best ways to meet professionals in your field, learn new topics and to make great connections overall. During this conference we were able to learn how goldman sachs uses big data in security selection.  </p>

											<h3>Logic Puzzles</h3>
											<p> Who doesn't love a logic game? Games that make me think out the box are enjoyable. However, this enjoyment can be a problem since I become so fixated on solving the puzzle; which can lead to hours of focus on one game. I hate giving up. When playing "Sudoku" or "0h h1" I refuse to quit because I know with every mistake I can take note and make sure I learn from that. </p>

											<h3>Enjoyment of Dance</h3>
											<p> Dance is not just my passion but, it is also an amazing stress reliever. Through dance not only did I make great connections with other artist, but my confidence in myself grew as well.  </p>
